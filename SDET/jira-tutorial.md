## Agile software development process model

### Agile process

* agile is an approach to software development under which **requirements and solutions** evolve through t**he collaborative effort** of self-organizing and **cross-functional teams** and their customer/end user

* both development and testing activities are concurrent unlike the waterfall model

agile team = tester + dev

### Epic, Story & Task

* Epic: why? Defines the business needs (big requirement)
* Feature/story: What? Defines the customer needs (smaller requirement)
* Task: How? Defines the solution

### Scrum Roles

* the scrum master
  * a scrum master is the facilitator for an agile development team
  * enable close cooperation across all roles and functions
* product owner
  * define the features of the product
  * decide on release date and content
  * prioritize features according to market value
  * adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed
  * accept or reject work results
* scrum team
  * developers and QA
